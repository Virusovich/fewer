# Getting Started

We will walk you through adding Fewer to an existing Node.js application.

## Installation

To install the latest version of fewer:

```
npm install --save fewer
```

You'll likely also want to globally install the CLI to help scaffold things out:

```
npm install --global @fewer/cli
